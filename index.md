This site hosts a collaborative census of the reconciliation ecosystem: available services, clients, libraries and anything else we need to be aware of when drafting formal specifications for an improved protocol.

Its contents can be [edited directly on GitHub](https://github.com/reconciliation-api/census/tree/master/_pages). Please join the [W3C Entity Reconciliation Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/reconciliation/) to be added to the GitHub
organization: this will let you edit the pages directly.
