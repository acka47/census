This page lists available reconciliation services.

## Hosted services

A list of hosted services is maintained on Wikidata and can be viewed
in our [reconciliation test bench](https://reconciliation-api.github.io/testbench/).

Other reconciliation services (including discontinued services) can be found on [OpenRefine's wiki](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/Reconcilable-Data-Sources).

## Servers

Beyond publicly available hosted services, some software exposes reconciliation endpoints locally.

### reconcile-csv

reconcile-csv can be used to run a reconciliation service off any CSV file.

### OpenRefine's RDF extension

The RDF extension can be used to wrap a SPARQL endpoint into a reconciliation service.
